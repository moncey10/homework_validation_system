Sample output file created manually
====================================

This file demonstrates that the outputs folder is ready to receive files.

When the homework validation API is called, annotated PDF files will be automatically created here with the naming pattern:
marked_{homework_id}_{student_id}_{timestamp}.pdf

The PDF files contain:
- Status header (Verified/Partial/Needs Review)
- Score percentage
- Tickmarks for each question (✓ = correct, ✗ = wrong, ○ = unattempted)
- MCQ summary

Generated at runtime by app.py when /homework/validate endpoint is called.
